What is IaC: Infrastructure as code

What is Terraform:
1: Infra structure as a code automation tool
2: Open Source designed by Hashi-Corp written in go language
3: It allows user to create infra with code

Why Terraform:
1: Terraform works on the principle of api as code
2: Interacts with Low Level Code
3: Supports multiple Cloud Providers/Hybrid Cloud
4: Written in Go language
5: HCL language/Json

What are essential aspects of terraform:
1: A console to validate the functions
2: Interpolation is supported through a configuration language
3: A Module count maintains track of how many resources are installed on the infrastructures

What are modules in terraform:
1: Logical Grouping of terraform resources
2: one module can run multiple environment/teams
3: One Module for multiple Teams
4: Commonly repeated things should be allocated in single file
5:

What is state file in terraform:
1: Keeps Track of resources are managing
2: Terraform makes copy of which resources we have created

What is Terraform D:
Terraform D is a windows plugin that works with almost all in-service systems. By Default Terraform init looks for plugins in the following directory

What is the purpose of Null Resources:
A standard resource library is implemented by null resources but no further action is done

Most Common CLI Commands:

1: Terraform init
2: Terraform plan
3: Terraform apply
4: Terraform Destroy
5: Terraform destroy --target="Resource-Name"
6: Terraform refresh
7: Terraform output
8: Terraform Graph

What is terraform backend:
1: Where ever we are storing our terraform state file is called backend

What is terraform remote backend:
1: To remove conflicts between your team and you we will store this state file in Remote backend
2: And we store that in some where in Cloud and enables locking it
3: so that if one user is creating resources using that remote backend statefile he will get error like some has locked the file or creating the infra

How do you handle secrets in terraform:
1: Using Environment variables
2: Using Hashi-Corp Vault
3: Store ssm parameters store
4: Use sensitive keyword = true in terraform
5: Store the state file in remote backend and enforce it with the strict iam policies
6: Secure remote backend

What is resource graph in terraform:
terraform graph is a dependency graph
it is actually a dependency plan

What is Terraform state Locking:
when you don't want to run multiple people at a time
Using DynamoDB Locking

What is Taint Terraform Resource :
1: A particular resources is degraded or damaged needs to restart then in next apply this will get execute

What is Terraform state rollback:
Roll back into terraform state

How will you upgrade plugins in terraform:
using # terraform init -upgrade

How will you make an object of one module available for the other module at a high level:
1: Module 1(Providing Outputs) which create a Resources and gives an output Parent

2: Module 2(Consuming Outputs) which takes that output to create a resources

What are the components that make up terraform architecture:
1: Sub-Graphs
2: Evaluation of Expressions
3: Evaluation of vertex
4: Walk The Graph

Define Resources Graph:
A resource graph is used to depict the resources.it allows you to simultaneously alter and produce various resources

Provide a Few examples of where we can use sentinel policies:
1: Make a Unambiguous ownership of resources a must
2: Limit the roles that cloud provider can play
3: Examine the terraform cloud operations audit trail
4: Only particular resources ,services or data sources are prohibited

Degrees of Sentinel Policing:
1: Advisory
2: Soft Mandatory
3: Hard Mandatory

What is terragrunt:
Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple
Terraform modules, remote state, and locking.

1: Managing numerous aws accounts
2: Managing infra on multiple modules
3: Using terragrunt we use dry principle

What is State File Locking:

How do you deploy Infra using Terraform:
1: Create

Problems with terraform:
1: Terraform communicates to a lot of apis but terraform itself does not have an API

2: Terraform State
a: Monolithic
b: Needs Locking
c: Cannot Modify the piece of infra

How to pass environment variables in Terraform:

Using the Export TF_VAR_example_var="custom_value"
export

When you mention terraform variable as sensitive will it show in terraform apply command:
it will hide the sensitive data even when you apply

How to list the created resources in terraform:
terraform state list

Count the resources using length function:
output "number of resources" {
  value = length(aws_instance.example)
}

When two files attempt to define the same object terraform returns an error
