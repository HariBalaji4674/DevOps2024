Order of Learning DSA:
1: One Programming Language(C++,Java,Python,JavaScript)

2: Learn DSA Basics

3: Learn Language Libraries that have DSA Implemented for you

4: Do Practice and Learning together

5: Keep Learning

# What is DSA : Data Structures and Algorithims

# Data Structures Struturing the data in Memory and Ram to Make the efficient the systems memory usage

# Algorithims: Sequence of steps written to solve any problem to optmize the memory and Time to save the costs of organizations
