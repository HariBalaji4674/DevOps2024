There are different Types of Scanning:
1: Static Source Code Analysis
- checks the source code analysis it and can give recommendations

2: Dynamic Source Code Analysis
- mocks the process of code at runtime,Mocks the process of hacking

3: Static Application Security Testing
- Checks for Passwords or environment variables

What is Sonar-Cube:
Open source Application code analysis platform where it will checks the code quality,identify bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code bad smells.
Security Vulnerabilities in Code Database
Code Smells
Detect Bugs

Key Features Of SonarQube:
Code Quality analysis
Detection of Code Smells
Bugs
Vulnerabilities
Security Hotpots
Code Duplication
Quality Gates
Threshold Value
Integrating with various languages
tools
reporting

Sonar Port Number: 9000

Installation of Sonar Cube:
Install Sonar Cube
Install Sonar Scanner in Agents
Configure Sonar Cube Ip Address in Sonar Scanner Properties.

Quality Gates: DevOps Engineer Role

Threshold Value: A Value set by the team do not increase that

Conditions:
Technical Debt Measure:
Code Coverage : 80% Above
Number of Blocker:
Critical Issues:
Security rating/Review : A
Unit Test Pass Rate: Above 85%
Code Smells : Indication of Deeper problem where hackers can get the access
Bugs: Difference between actual and Expected results

What is Technical Debt:
How much time will take to clear all the issues

What is Code Coverage:
Percentage of code executed by tests

What is Static Analysis & Dynamic Analysis:

Key metrics:
1: Code Coverage
2: Cyclomatic Complexity
3: Code Duplication

Wait for Quality Gate :
def qg = waitForQualityGate()
if(qg.status != 'OK')
