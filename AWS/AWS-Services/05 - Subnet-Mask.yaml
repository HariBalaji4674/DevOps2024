Subnet Masking:
***************

	IP Address: Network Address + Host Address
Each Network has Different Network ids
Each Network Has Different Hosts
Each Ip address Has both network and host address\

Ip Address Has Unique number for each host
 
Class -A
--------- 
	8 Bits -- Network ID
	24 Bits -- Host ID
	# 192.234.100.100 --> IP Adress
	192 --> network ID
	234 . 100 .100 --> Host ID
Class B:
--------
	16 Bits for Network ID
	16 Bits for Host ID
	# 192.234.100.100 --> IP Adress
	192 .234 --> network ID
	100 .100 --> Host ID
Class C:
--------
	24 Bits for Network ID
	8 Bits for Host ID
	# 192.234.100.100 --> IP Adress
	192 .234 .100 -> network ID
	100 --> Host ID

0 is representing the Network ID
255 is representing the BroadCasting purpose

Total 256 Hosts can come for each 8 bits octet 
then if we remove 2 id we will get 254 hosts per 8 bits octet.

Class Less InterDomain Routing
